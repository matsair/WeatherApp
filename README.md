# WeatherApp

This Android app shows the weather within a specified radius of one's current location.

It uses the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.

The icon was created with Android Asset Studio: http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio

The cloud icon within the app was taken from Icons8: http://icons8.com/web-app/649/Clouds

Tested on Nexus 5 and Galaxy S4.

##### Todo
1. Update weather icons using icons from OpenWeatherAPI
2. Fix bug were nothing is shown in the app. Caused by turning off GPS. Once GPS is turned on again, the bug persists
3. Fix bug were app crashes when Wifi and Location are disabled
4. Improve SwipeToRefresh
5. Improve getting the users location
