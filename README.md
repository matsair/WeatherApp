# WeatherApp

This Android app shows the weather within a specified radius of one's current location.

It uses the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.

The icon was created with Android Asset Studio: http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio

The cloud icon within the app was taken from Icons8: http://icons8.com/web-app/649/Clouds

Tested on Nexus 5 and Galaxy S4. The Galaxy S4 seems to have a bug though, for which I haven't built/found a fix: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18028666/senduseractionevent-is-null

##### Todo
1. Update weather icons using icons from OpenWeatherAPI
