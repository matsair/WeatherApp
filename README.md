# WeatherApp

This Android app shows the weather within a specified radius of one's current location.

It uses the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.

The icon was created with Android Asset Studio: http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio

The cloud icon within the app was taken from Icons8: http://icons8.com/web-app/649/Clouds

Tested on Nexus 5 and Galaxy S4.

##### Todo
1. Update weather icons using icons from OpenWeatherAPI
2. __FIXED__ Fix bug were nothing is shown in the app. Caused by turning off GPS. Once GPS is turned on again, the bug persists
3. __FIXED__ Fix bug were app crashes when Wifi and Location are disabled
4. __IN_PROGRESS__ Improve SwipeToRefresh. The icon needs to spin longer and the "Don't panic" dialog shouldn't be shown.
5. __DONE__ Improve getting the users location
